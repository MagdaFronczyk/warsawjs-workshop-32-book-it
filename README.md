# warsawjs-workshop-32-book-it

This project will be implemented during WarsawJS Workshops #32.

## Preparation

1. Clone this repository. Enter the folder with the project on your computer through terminal.
2. Install all dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn` from terminal.
3. Try running the project. To do so, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.

TA-DAM! ;)

4. Now you'd probably want this project to land on you GitHub profile in the future. In order to prepare for that, you
should do just a few more steps:
 - Go to your GitHub and create a new repository. Make sure to name it `warsawjs-workshop-32-book-it`
 - In your local folder with the project, run `rm -rf .git`
 - Initialize git by running `git init`
 - Add a remote repository url linking to YOUR repo on GitHub. The command will look like this:
    `git remote add origin git@github.com:[YOUR_NICKNAME]/warsawjs-workshop-32-book-it.git`
    (you can also find this link when creating a repo)
5. If you have any troubles, feel free to reach me on Slack (@tati) directly or through a channel specifically created
for our group (warsawjs-workshop-32-1) or by email platonovatetiana@gmail.com

And most importantly:
6. Prepare to have some fun during the workshop! Don't forget to bring a smile with you ;)
